Analysis of Market Reversal Indicators:

Data Overview:
Analyzed 35,341 price points
Identified 6,698 reversal points (3,433 upward, 3,265 downward)
Most Effective Upward Reversal Pattern (60% accuracy): Indicator combination signaling potential upward reversal:
ADX around 40-45 (showing strong trend)
Negative MACD (showing downward momentum ending)
StochRSI near oversold (-15 to -20)
Momentum and ROC near zero (showing momentum shift)
ATR around 0.69 (moderate volatility)
Bollinger Band %B below -10 (price below bands)
Negative CMF (-0.23) but Positive OBV (showing accumulation)
Most Effective Downward Reversal Pattern (66.7% accuracy): Indicator combination signaling potential downward reversal:
ADX around 30-35 (showing moderate trend)
Positive MACD (showing upward momentum ending)
StochRSI overbought (>100)
Momentum and ROC positive (~1.3, showing exhaustion)
ATR around 1.08 (higher volatility)
Bollinger Band %B above 95 (price above bands)
Both CMF and OBV positive (showing distribution phase)
Key Findings:

Downward reversals show higher prediction accuracy (66.7%) compared to upward reversals (60%)
Strong indicator combinations include:
Trend exhaustion (ADX + MACD)
Overbought/Oversold conditions (StochRSI + BB%B)
Volume confirmation (CMF + OBV)
Most reliable signals occur when multiple indicators align across different categories (trend, momentum, volatility, and volume)
